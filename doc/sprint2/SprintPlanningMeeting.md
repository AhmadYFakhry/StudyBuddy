 # Sprint Planning Meeting

 ## Participants: fakhryah, asadali, chuantho, syedelha, bhangalg, aranhas1, hafezos1

---------------------------------

 ### Meeting Goal: What is our goal for the sprint?

 Make the app somewhat functional from the front-end as well as on the back-end.

 To accomplish this. We need to have 3 basic functionalities:

 1. A login and registration process that works from the front-end.
 2. A timer that works and can be edited (break and study timer)
 3. Be able to create a list and add a task to it from the front-end

---------------------------------

## Spikes

1. Midterms and assignments from other courses that are due right after/during the reading week break.
2. We are still very new to the stack (MERN), so working with it takes longer, especially when we run into errors.

---------------------------------

## Team Capacity

For this sprint, we esimated our team capacity to be at around the previous projected team capactiy which was 72.
