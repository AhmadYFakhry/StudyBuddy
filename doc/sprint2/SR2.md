# Sprint 2 Retrospective

## Participants: fakhryah, asadali, chuantho, syedelha, bhangalg, aranhas1, hafezos1

-------------------------------------------------

### Our Good Practices
-------------------------------------------------

1. Our existing stories on Jira are easy to understand, as in priorities are given, estimates are given using a particular format, in our case the fibonachi format. Subtasks are given and are decently clear but can get better.

2. Our daily standups are done generally at the same time and are meaningful.

3. The master branch on Git is never used for commits, no matter what.

### Our Bad Practices 
-------------------------------------------------

1. Bugs are not reported properly on Jira and as a result, can not be found and dealt with easily

2. We get a lot of merge conflicts, and now the master branch needs to be cleaned up properly. This is due to dependant stories.

3. Our Daily standup meetings are not properly spaced out, despite them being meaningful
