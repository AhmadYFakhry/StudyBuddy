What was the goal for sprint one? 
-------------------------------------------------

In sprint 1, we wanted to lay down the architecture for our web application. We wanted to be able to use the task manager aspect as an API that could be used on Postman. We also wanted to create front-end (React) components that will call on the API to authenticate users. 

Spikes
-------------------------------------------------

The first major spike for us is other course work, the sprint is happening during a very academically heavy time for all members. So ideal days are very limited for everyone. 
The second major spike for us was learning the new technologies associated with the sprint. That includes MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS. This also lowered productivity but we do not believe this will an issue in later sprints.

Team capacity
-------------------------------------------------

Our team capacity per sprint is 72

Practicies we successfully implemented and want to continue.
-------------------------------------------------

As a group, although we were not able to completely conform to it in the best way possible, we've tried our best to implement MVC. In order to improve on our code we want to adapt better design patterns and this will hopefully strengthen our MVC adaptation.

Practices we want to implement in the next sprint.
-------------------------------------------------

Separating the Model from the View and the Controller, allowing any new additions to the code to be cleaner for the reader. Add more comments to our code to clarify any miscommunication and prevent any misunderstandings. Meet more in person to efficiently communicate ideas.

Harmful Practices
-------------------------------------------------

Not communicating efficiently or having comments on written code, this confuses members on existing code and causes strife in the groups.

Best/Worst Experiences
-------------------------------------------------

Best experiences that group members felt was enjoying coding in CSS and HTML. The worst experiences was constantly trying to balance other school work and keep up with the project and assignment.
