THE 3-TIERED ARCHITECTURE

• Our presentation tier is REACT, which is majority HTML and CSS showing the UI of our web app.
• The application tier is NodeJS and Express communicating between Mongo and React.
• The data tier is MongoDB which stoers our users, tasks and lists.

For a visual of our 3 tier architecture, look at Software Architecture Design.png.
