Release Planning Meeting
-------------------------------------------------

Participants: fakhryah, asadali, chuantho, syedelha, bhangalg, aranhas1, hafezos1

The goal of the release is to have a fully functional and free web app, an ideal studying app for anyone who wants to focus in and get work done. An integrated pomodoro timer [STUD-6], pomodoro being a technique of studying for 25 minutes and on break for 5 minutes, a proven and efficient studying technique. 

There will also be a Facebook api integration [STUD-42] as well as a web spotify bar to listen to music on to [STUD-11]. To assist users in staying organized, clients can use the Google Calendar API [STUD-13] to import their calendars so that they can schedule their study sessions around their daily events. 

We also want to give rewards (badges) for being a constant user of the web app [STUD-10]. Incentive to use our application. :)

More ideas may be added as the project goes on.
