# Sprint 3 Retrospective

## Participants: fakhryah, asadali, chuantho, syedelha, bhangalg, aranhas1, hafezos1

-------------------------------------------------

### Our Good Practices
-------------------------------------------------

1. Our daily standups are done generally at the same time and are meaningful.

2. The master branch on Git is never used for commits, no matter what.

3. Bugs were reported on Jira and as a result, dealt with

4. Our master branch is clean

### Our Bad Practices 
-------------------------------------------------

1. We started a bit late on the sprint due to our other courses
