# Sprint 3 Planning Meeting

 ## Participants: fakhryah, asadali, chuantho, syedelha, bhangalg, aranhas1, hafezos1

---------------------------------

 ### Meeting Goal: What is our goal for the sprint?

Fix all loose ends for our application, and improve the user experience.

We plan to accomplish the betterment of the user experience by:

1. Creating one cohesive design through a loose mockup, and then implementing that using CSS styling
2. Create a profile page that allows users to edit their personal information such as their emails and passwords
3. Being able to drag and drop tasks between lists

Lastly, we  want only authenticated users to be able to use our application, so we will be hiding all elements behind a login and registration wall

---------------------------------

## Spikes

1. None of us are designers, so coming up with a colour scheme that is accessible for users as well as attractive will be slightly out of our comfort zone.
2. We are all still a little new to our front-end technology (React), so achieving a cohesive user experience may take a little more work than usual.

---------------------------------

## Team Capacity

For this sprint, we esimated our team capacity to be at around the previous projected team capactiy which was 76.
