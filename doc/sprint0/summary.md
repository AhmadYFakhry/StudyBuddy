# What is Study Buddy?

Study buddy is a task-manager web app built with MERN Stack. It is an application where people can
both manage their study tasks using the [Pomodoro technique](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730), an acclaimed time management method, to assist busy students in studying more effectively and efficiently
Adding on to this, StudyBuddy adds implementations of smaller things that students may or may not want to access during their studying “sessions”. The features include:

## Calendar

When signing up, users have the chance to set up their calendars with our app.
With the use of the Google Calendar API, users can import their calendars and add from there, or just create an entirely new calendar.
This is to make sure that if the user is studying between classes, if their session overlaps with any upcoming classes, they will be notified and given the option to continue or not begin the session.

## Spotify Connect Web Player

Most students love to listen to music while they complete their tasks, instead of having to switch back and forth between their Spotify player and their browser.
By implementing a Spotify Connect Player into the application, users can play/pause, go to the next song, and go to the previous song as long as they have any type of Spotify account

# Who are our key users?

### Alessandro Esteves
a 20-year university student taking 5 courses who finds it hard to stay organized when all his deadlines are coming up. 

### Maria Chu
a 15-year-old high school student who is new to the high school life.

### Brian White
 a 40-year-old man who is continuing his studies by doing online courses at websites like Udemy and Udacity.

# What are key scenarios?

Alessandro has a lot coming up in two weeks, 2 assignments on Friday, a test on Wednesday and an essay on Tuesday. He's determined to get it all done well and wants a structured system in order to properly manage his times in between his classes.

Maria wants to be able to structure her week to study a certain number of units per day, she also wants to listen to music at the same time because it gives her some background noise.

Brian generally starts studying after he drops off his kids at school and stops when he has to pick his children up from school. However, sometimes he forgets the time and is late to pick them up, which is obviously not good.

# What are our key principles?

### Free-to-Use
We believe that applications aimed at students should not try to monetize them at all. The biggest pushback when it comes to applications is the paywall that developers put up. Making a free, public task managing app with a Pomodoro timer, the two together can help people focus and finish their tasks.
Because of this, our product compromises and only uses APIs that do not require capital.

### Simplicity
Any good design should focus first on the functionality instead of making things look good, as a result, we plan to make our user interface as simple as possible.

### Accessibility
Our application should be able to be used by anyone regardless of who they are. Our design will keep the adhere to accessibility principles.
