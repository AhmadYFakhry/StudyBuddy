# Our Competition

From our research, our competition lacks in two main areas for students. Those being effectiveness and price

# Effectiveness

Competitors that we looked lacked the ability to cater for students to help them studying effectively. For example, tomato-timer.com has a simple UI with the just the timer and some button but lack ease of access features such as the calendar or spotify integrations to decrease the need to switch between tasks. We also offer analytics for our users to see how effective they've been in their past sessions, giving them some things to reflect on and in turn, provide the ability to improve.

# Pricing

Our product will be 100% free, considering our feature set, none of the competitors that come close to us in terms of features have an option for a free version where they host things like calendars or usability on multiple devices. We believe that products designed for students should be free since they already spend enough on their education in the first place.
