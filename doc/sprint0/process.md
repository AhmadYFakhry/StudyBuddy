Our team planned to work effectively and efficiently from the very get go. The first thing we did as a team was to decide who the leader of the group would be. This will allow us to work on smaller tasks alone or in smaller groups throughout the project. Each sub group or individual is expected to update the leader when they have completed a task. This allows our team to be more efficient and limits to the number of conflicts that can arise because the leader is the final decision maker and his decision has the greatest influence, his say has the greatest priority.

Decisions are made by the leader and other members are allowed to make suggestions, critique decisions made by the leader. The leader has final say on every matter.


Our team used the following tools to keep everyone on the same page:

Google Drive:
For real-time multiple user editing
Discord (3 meetings):
For voice-voice communication
Whatsapp (everyday)
Quick messages, updates, announcements

We also met twice in person in order to decide the user stories and discuss what we wanted the final product to be.

Suggestions for user stories were brought up every time we met, whether it be online or through in person meetings. The task of prioritization was handed to one individual, after which the final list was presented to other team members who would give their feedback and input as to whether there was a change that needed to be made. It only took one review from the whole team. Finally, the group leader took a look and approved the final list. The user story prioritization was finalized by the 28th.

Moving forwards, we should have better physical equipment for online meetings on discord (i.e. microphones) because even one bad microphone, for example,  ruins the experience for others who find it hard to communicate due to an echo or problems hearing the other person. Another suggestion moving forward would be to prepare before we actually begin touching any of the code, ensure that each person who plans on working on a user story has the necessary skills for those tasks.
