Methods of Communication

We will be using two methods of communication, namely, the whatsapp group, mostly to facilitate meetings and coordinating tutorials, and Discord which we can use to facilitate meetings as well as review issues easily. Generally, discord will be used to replace meetings if we cannot have them in person. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Preferred Method of Communication

Our preferred method of communication is WhatsApp but we prefer face-to-face meetings.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Communication Response Times

The average response time amongst the group is about an hour to around 4 hours. Nothing longer than an entire day.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Standup/other Agile Meetings 

In terms of meetings, we will be using 2 modes of meetings. Firstly, we'll use face-to-face meetings at a specified room a few days before the tutorial. Secondly, we'll be using Discord to meet up since it is more flexible and online. Finally, the person responsible for taking meetings minutes (a format of note taking in meetings) rotates every meeting.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Meeting Preperation

For meetings, the topic of the meeting is known before-hand. Members are to bring their laptops and present their issues or bring up new ideas. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Version Control

We will commit as often as needed, but please stick to your branch.
Make sure your changes are meaningful. Each commit message needs to specify what was changed in the files that were commited and what user story it is associated with.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Roles and Division of Work

There will be 2 divisions for the application. Specifically, Front-end and Back-end

Front-end work will include any work that has to do with the React
Back-end work will include any code that has to do with routing, databasing.

To ensure proper the front-end team understands what the back-end team is doing, documentation will be written on the requests.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Submitting Sprint Deliverables and Software

Every submission will be checked by Travis CI before any subsequent decisions are made.

2 weeks before the sprint due date, the team would like at least 40% of the features to be implemented.  

1 week before the sprint due date, the team would like at least 70% of the features to be implemented.

3 days before the sprint due date, the team will do a code review to make sure everyone is on the same page.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Contingency Planning

If a team member drops out, we will equally distribute their responsibilites on the rest of the team members.

If a team member is academically dishonest or does not pull their weight, the group leader will report it to the appropriate authority.
