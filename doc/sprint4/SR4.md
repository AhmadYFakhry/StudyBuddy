# Sprint 4 Retrospective

## Participants: fakhryah, asadali, chuantho, syedelha, bhangalg, aranhas1, hafezos1

-------------------------------------------------

### Our Good Practices
-------------------------------------------------

1. Our daily standups are done generally at the same time and are meaningful.

2. The master branch on Git is never used for commits, no matter what.

3. Bugs were reported on Jira and as a result, dealt with

4. Our master branch is clean

5. No merge conflicts on the master. Good and clean coding practice

6. Solid communication amongst all team members

### Our Bad Practices 
-------------------------------------------------

1. We started a bit late on the sprint due to our other courses

2. Our daily standups could've been more spread out

3. Were forced to flag a few user stories due to them being impossible
